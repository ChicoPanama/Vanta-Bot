- **AWS KMS integration**: Optional AWS KMS integration for production deployments

### Contract Address Protection
- **Legacy address detection**: Automatic detection and prevention of deprecated address usage
- **Startup validation**: Application startup validates all addresses against legacy lists
- **Clear error messages**: Detailed remediation instructions when deprecated addresses are detected

### Input Validation
- **Multi-layer validation**: Comprehensive validation at multiple levels
- **Risk limits**: Built-in risk management with configurable limits
- **Parameter clamping**: Automatic clamping of parameters to safe ranges
- **Business rule enforcement**: Strict enforcement of trading business rules

### Error Handling
- **Secure error messages**: Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- **Graceful degradation**: Application continues operating even with non-critical failures
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed logging for debugging without exposing secrets

## üîê Environment Security

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Blockchain Configuration
BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
TRADER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Telegram Configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here

# Optional: AWS KMS
AWS_KMS_KEY_ID=your_kms_key_id
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Environment File Security
- **`.env` files ignored**: All `.env` files are gitignored
- **Template provided**: `env/.env.example` provides safe template
- **No secrets in repo**: No secrets should ever be committed to the repository

## üö® Security Incident Response

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability in public forums
3. **Email** security concerns to: security@avantis.trading
4. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability
5. **Wait** for response and guidance

### Response Timeline
- **Initial response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix development**: Within 1 week
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is deployed

## üîç Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables or secure vaults
- **Validate all inputs**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for external communications
- **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- **Review code**: Code reviews should include security considerations

### For Operators
- **Secure environment**: Ensure production environment is properly secured
- **Monitor logs**: Regularly monitor application logs for suspicious activity
- **Backup keys**: Maintain secure backups of encryption keys
- **Access control**: Implement proper access controls for production systems
- **Network security**: Use firewalls and network segmentation

### For Users
- **Secure wallet**: Use hardware wallets or secure wallet software
- **Private key protection**: Never share private keys or seed phrases
- **Verify transactions**: Always verify transactions before confirming
- **Stay updated**: Keep the bot updated to latest secure version
- **Report issues**: Report any security concerns immediately

## üîß Security Configuration

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Use secure RPC endpoints
BASE_RPC_URL=https://your-secure-rpc-endpoint.com

# Use AWS KMS for key management
AWS_KMS_KEY_ID=your-kms-key-id
AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Enable encryption
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-byte-hex-key

# Use secure database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@secure-db:5432/bot
```

### Development Environment
```bash
# Use testnet for development
BASE_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
TRADER_PRIVATE_KEY=test-private-key

# Use local database
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///test.db
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools

### Pre-commit Hooks
- **Secret detection**: Automatic detection of secrets in code
- **Dependency scanning**: Check for known vulnerabilities
