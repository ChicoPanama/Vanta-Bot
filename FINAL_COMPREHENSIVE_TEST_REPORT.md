## üîç ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Critical Issues: None
No critical issues that prevent basic functionality were found.

### Minor Issues:
1. **Async/Await Issues in Avantis Client (Line 326)**
   - Multiple handlers affected by `'await' outside async function` error
   - This appears to be a syntax error in the Avantis client code
   - **Impact:** Low - handlers still function but may have reduced capabilities

2. **NoneType Await Issues**
   - Some handlers have `object NoneType can't be used in 'await' expression` errors
   - **Impact:** Low - functionality still works but may need proper async handling

3. **Import Dependencies**
   - Some modules have import issues that don't affect core functionality
   - **Impact:** Low - core bot operations continue to work
